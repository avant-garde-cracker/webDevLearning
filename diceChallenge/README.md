# diceChallenge

Let me explain how this fun dice game works. Each time you refresh the page, the dice roll again to reveal new random numbers. It's like getting a brand new pair of dice to play with every round! The magic behind the random rolls comes from a clever bit of JavaScript code called Math.random(). This function can spit out a random number between 0 and 1 every time it's called. We use it to generate random dice rolls between 1 and 6 for each player. After the dice land, we check who rolled highest. That lucky player is declared the winner! Sometimes when both the players end up with the same number, they Draw! Then just hit refresh and we get to play again with new random dice rolls. Keep rolling for another shot at the top score!
